# Technical Overview

This Java project is based on Maven and Webpack and uses spring framework and react.
There is a strict seperation between frontend and backend.
Currently you can choose between three profiles:
Per default ePill is using H2 database for development mode which is very comfortable when developing
locally. For configurations see:
	/src/main/resources/application.properties
		
When deployed to heroku as a running instance have a look at application-heroku.properties. When using
heroku profile ePill uses postgres database. For configurations see:
	/src/main/resources/application-heroku.properties


To execute epill-1.9-SNAPSHOT.jar on epill.uni-kassel.de use "uni" profile:
	java -jar epill.jar --spring.profiles.active='uni'


To keep the application alive after closing SSH connection use:
	nohup java -jar epill.jar --spring.profiles.active='uni' &


Frontend was developed using react and Webpack. Webpack-dependencies can be added in:
	/src/main/frontend/package.json
	

For changes regarding the frontend have a look at 
	/src/main/frontend/src/**

	
The frontend is built into spring public folder:
	/src/main/resources/public/***
	
	
For serialization of bidirectional connections SDMLib is used. For further information
have a look at:
	com.doccuty.epill.model.util.*

# Initial Data
The initial data is inserted by executing sql from /src/main/resources/*.sql for
the respective, active profile.
For Unit testing use

	/src/test/resources/data-h2-test.sql.
